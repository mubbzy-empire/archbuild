# ArchVision Professional

Upload a blueprint (or describe a design in chat) and get:

- An **editable, interactive 3D model** — click any wall, roof section, door, or window
  and drag it with an on-screen gizmo (like Blender) to move it, or switch the gizmo to
  **Rotate** to spin it in place. The interior is hidden behind the roof by default and
  only opens up when you press the **"Show interior"** button — the model itself only
  loads once you press **"View 3D model"**, instead of building automatically
- Real **cut-through doors and windows** (actual holes in the walls, not decals) using
  boolean geometry — including **interior doors that connect one demarcated room to the
  next**, cut into the partition wall between them, not just decorative dividers
- Click any part or room for a quick **info panel** (element type, room, floor, material)
- **Dimensions, materials, equipment, and a build sequence**
- A **budget & cost estimate** — enter a number and get a rough materials/labor/timeline
  range, with the AI attempting a live web-informed estimate when possible
- A **chat design mode** that drafts and colors the architecture automatically (no furniture — this is an architectural modeler, not an interior designer)
- A **photorealistic AI concept render** alongside the interactive model
- **Multi-building estates/compounds** — describe a whole development and get several
  independently-editable buildings placed on a site with a procedural (non-AI, guaranteed
  non-overlapping) road/plot layout, browsable in a Scene Explorer. The site layout
  itself is editable too — drag a building to a new plot or rotate it in place with the
  same gizmo, or drill into one building for full part-level editing
- A **manual 3D modeler** — draw real walls point-to-point, cut real door/window openings
  into them, and place freestanding primitives from a completely empty scene, no AI
  involved, with select/move, undo/redo, and save
- **Version history** on any project — checkpoint the current design under a label and
  restore an earlier one later

Built primarily for **architects and design professionals** — see the in-app disclaimer.
Desktop-optimized (side navigation, split-screen results view) with full mobile support.

Stack: **React + Vite** (frontend), **Node/Express + SQLite** (backend), **Three.js +
three-bvh-csg** (3D rendering and boolean geometry), optional **Google Gemini free-tier
API** for real AI vision/chat/cost reasoning, with a built-in **offline analysis engine**
so the app works with no API key and no cost.

---

## 1. What you need installed first

- **Node.js 18 or newer**: https://nodejs.org (choose "LTS")

That's the only prerequisite — SQLite is embedded, no separate database server needed.

---

## 2. Unzip and install

```bash
cd path/to/ArchVision-Phase38-Repo
npm run install:all
```

---

## 3. (Recommended) Connect a free AI key

Without a key, the app works immediately via a built-in offline engine (rule-based
templates for common building types). For real blueprint reading, room-partitioned
chat design, photorealistic renders, and cost estimates, connect a free Gemini key:

1. https://aistudio.google.com/apikey → sign in → **Create API key** (free, no card).
2. In `archview/backend`, copy `.env.example` to `.env`.
3. Paste your key: `GEMINI_API_KEY=your-key-here` (works with both `AIza...` and `AQ....`
   key formats).
4. Save, then restart the backend if it's already running.

The top bar shows **"AI: GEMINI"** when connected, or **"AI: OFFLINE ENGINE"** when not.

---

## 4. Run it

```bash
npm run dev
```

Starts the backend (`http://localhost:4000`) and frontend (`http://localhost:5173`)
together. Open **http://localhost:5173** in your browser. `Ctrl+C` to stop.

---

## 5. Using the 3D editor

- **Orbit:** drag anywhere on the model to rotate, scroll/pinch to zoom.
- **Edit parts:** tap "Edit parts" in the viewer, then click any wall/roof/door/window/
  part. A 3-axis drag gizmo appears — **Move** drags that part along an axis, **Rotate**
  spins it in place around the same gizmo. Pull a wall or the roof away to see inside.
- **Part info:** tap any part any time (even outside edit mode) to see its element type,
  room, floor, and material in a small overlay panel.
- **Reset positions:** undoes all manual moves/rotations back to the AI's original layout.
- **Interior view:** one-tap roof removal without manual dragging.
- **Color swatches:** below the viewer, recolor walls/roof/door/windows live.
- **Version history:** save a labeled checkpoint any time from the Results page, and
  restore an earlier one later — works for single buildings and whole estates.

## 6. Estates / compounds

Go to **Estate** in the nav, describe the whole development (mix of house types, shared
facilities, style — e.g. "10 houses, house 1 is a 4-bed duplex, houses 2-5 are 3-bed
duplexes, houses 6-10 are modern 4-bed homes, add a gatehouse and shared garden"), set
building count and site size, and generate. Each building is generated individually
through the same real-geometry pipeline as a single design; the site layout (grid
positions, road spacing, non-overlap) is placed **procedurally, not by the AI**, so it's
geometrically guaranteed correct regardless of what the AI does with each building's
shape. Use the Scene Explorer to select/hide/focus individual buildings, and tap a
building to open its own editable 3D view below (full part-level editing, same as a
single-building project). To rearrange the site itself, tap **"Edit layout"** in the
estate viewer, then click any building and drag it to a new plot (**Move**) or spin it
(**Rotate**) — constrained to the ground plane so a building can't be lifted into the
air or tipped over. **"Reset layout"** undoes every manual move back to the generated
plot positions.

---

## 7. Manual modeler (no AI)

Go to **Modeler** in the nav to build entirely from scratch: pick the **Wall** tool and
click a start point then an end point to draw a wall; **Door**/**Window** to click an
existing wall and cut a real opening into it; **Box**/**Cylinder** for freestanding
primitives. **Select** lets you click any part and drag it with a gizmo (moving a wall
carries its doors/windows with it). The Properties panel edits size/material/color
numerically; Undo/Redo covers every action; Save writes it as a normal project you can
reopen, edit further, or export to `.glb` like any AI-generated design.

---

## 8. Hosting it online for free

Same process as any Node app on Render — see the in-repo `render.yaml`. Push this
project to a GitHub repo, create a new Web Service on [render.com](https://render.com)
pointing at it (Free instance type), add `GEMINI_API_KEY` as an environment variable in
Render's dashboard, and deploy. Render auto-detects the build/start commands from
`render.yaml`.

Free-tier notes: the instance sleeps after 15 minutes idle (30-60s to wake up on the
next visit), and has no permanent disk, so saved projects/images may reset when the
instance restarts.

## 10. Honest limitations to know about

- **Blueprint reading is best-effort, not exact.** The AI reads labeled dimensions and
  room layout as precisely as it can, but a hand-drawn or low-quality scan won't produce
  a pixel-perfect twin — treat results as an accurate concept, not a surveyed duplicate.
- **Cost estimates are AI-generated approximations**, not quotes. The app attempts real
  Google Search grounding for current pricing when a key is connected; when that's
  unavailable it falls back to AI reasoning, then to a simple offline formula. Always
  labeled clearly which mode produced a given estimate — always get local contractor
  quotes before committing to a number.
- **The 3D model is built from primitives** (boxes/cylinders) assembled by the AI or by
  hand, not a full architectural CAD engine — it's an accurate-to-scale concept model you
  can edit, not a construction-ready structural document.
- **Estate site layout is procedural, not engineered, but is manually adjustable.**
  Generated placement/road spacing is guaranteed non-overlapping by the grid math;
  dragging a building in "Edit layout" mode does not re-check for overlaps against
  its new spot, so keep an eye on it visually. Drainage, utilities, grading, and actual
  civil/site engineering are not modeled — that still needs a licensed engineer.
- **Manual-modeler wall rotate has one known gap:** rotating a freestanding box/cylinder
  with the gizmo works cleanly, but rotating a wall does not carry its attached
  doors/windows around with it (only a translate move does) — delete/re-place openings
  if you need to rotate a wall significantly.
- **Free-tier Gemini models get renamed/retired periodically** — if AI features stop
  working, check `backend/services/aiService.js` for the model name comments and
  https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models for the current equivalent.

## 11. Troubleshooting

- **"Cannot find module" errors** → run `npm run install:all` from the root.
- **Port already in use** → change `PORT` in `backend/.env` and the proxy in
  `frontend/vite.config.js` to match.
- **AI features erroring** → check your key in `backend/.env`, or remove it to fall back
  to the offline engine.
- **3D viewer blank or oddly shaped** → click "Reset positions" in the viewer controls;
  if it persists, the AI's generated part list may be malformed — try regenerating.

## 12. Professional architectural workbench (new)

The `/modeler` route is now the primary professional modeling environment. It is intentionally separate from the older manual modeler, which remains available at `/legacy-modeler` so no existing workflow is discarded.

The professional workbench is based on the same canonical Building IR used by Chat → 3D, Blueprint → 3D, and Estate → 3D. It adds:

- true 2D floor-plan drafting with metric snapping
- wall-by-wall modeling with real door/window openings
- columns, beams, slabs, roof, stairs and primitive objects
- floor/story navigation
- property inspection for walls and openings
- material coordination information
- electrical, plumbing, HVAC and fire/life-safety design-intent overlays
- 2D/3D switching without changing the underlying model
- roof/interior/MEP visibility controls
- undo/redo and project save
- direct hand-off from generated Chat/Blueprint projects into the workbench
- estate/site hand-off back to the dedicated estate workflow

The AI contract has also been tightened around a professional architectural brief. Gemini is no longer asked to invent arbitrary 3D box coordinates for residential architecture; it describes the design intent (program, massing, site, materials, roof, and building systems), while the deterministic architectural engine derives walls, rooms, openings, stairs, slabs, roof geometry and MEP coordination from that brief. This is the practical equivalent of rebuilding the architecture AI pipeline rather than continuing to patch raw coordinate generation.

## Phase 2 professional workbench

`/modeler` is now the production-oriented architectural workbench. It keeps the canonical Building IR as the source of truth and adds parametric-style editing, documentation annotations, schedules, QA, site/estate visibility, and discipline coordination.

The old manual modeler remains at `/legacy-modeler` as a fallback during hardening.
